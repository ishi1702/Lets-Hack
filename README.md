# Lets-Hack with Python

This repository aims to gather scripts made using Python that automate the process of various tasks.

## Python installation

First thing's first, if you don't have Python installed you'll need to get it. Python 3 is recommended, and you can find the download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Depending on what OS you're on, you might already have it installed. You can check with the command `python --version`, or `python3 --version` for Python 3 if it's not set as your default. For more information on that, you can check it out [here](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/chapter_01/osx_setup.html).

## How to use this repository

In this repository includes multiple scripts. All the scripts are separate from one another, so they can be run individually without relying on one another.

Some scripts may have its own requirements, so simply only having Python installed may not be enough to succesfully run the script. Scripts should have its own `README` that lists requirements needed to successfully run, so please refer to each individual script for more information. Chances are you'll need to use `pip` (which is very likely already installed if you have already installed Python) to install necessary modules to run some scripts so, again, please refer to each script for its own description of dependencies.

## Contributions

If you have any interesting scripts that you want to make, please feel free to create a PR. At the moment, there are no guidelines to follow for this repository. However, if you're writing in Python it may be helpful if you write your code keeping [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in mind. It helps keep code consistent with other Python developers.


## Extra

If you have don't have any ideas of what kind of scripts you can write with Python, you can take a look at [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). It's a very popular book that can help you understand exactly what you can do with the power of Python.
